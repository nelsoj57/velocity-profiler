# TESTING CbEventDrivenScheduler IN ISOLATION:
# 1. Test starting and stopping the scheduler
# 2. Test to make sure no more SamplePoints are being added after stopping the scheduler
#   - Test that stop() unregisters the callback function

# TESTING IntervalScheduler IN ISOLATION:


# TESTING CALLBACK FUNCTION IN ISOLATION:
# 1. Test if the callback function creates the expected SamplePoint with mode of interest: cmiFrequency1 = 28

# 2. Test if the callback function creates the expected SamplePoint with mode of interest: cmiFrequency2 = 29

# 3. Test if the callback function does NOT create a SamplePoint for an uninteresting mode: cmiVersion = 31


# TESTING CALLBACK FUNCTION AND SCHEDULER INTEGRATION: #TODO: likely just combine this test with the above tests
# 1-3. Equivelent to the above tests, being run through the scheduler and checking if the SamplePoints are being appended to the Schedulers queue correctly


# TESTING the SampleSession fa√ßade (May be unnecessary if not implemented)
