1. Contains the Wavemeter class, whose attributes represents the properties of the wavemeter device and methods represent DLL calls.
2. Containes the SampleWavemeter class which has a Wavemeter object and calls the methods of the Wavemeter Class and takes and processes the data #TODO: come up with a better name.
    - This is a base class (possibly abstract) that can be extended for different sampling/sweeping strategies
    - derived classes may include:
        - SampleWavemeterSingle: for single sampling (poll/request based sampling)
        - TimedSampleing: taking a sample for a fixed time period
            - There could be a class derived from this one for delayed sampling where the sampling starts after a specified delay or at a specified time
3. Possibly: Maybe a different class should hold a SampleWavemeter object and contains logic for starting and stopping samples and holding/processing the data
    -That would mean that the Sample Class would only have attributes and methods related to sampling and not data processing.



ACTUALLY this is how it will work:
1. Contains the Wavemeter class, whose attributes represents the properties of the wavemeter device and methods represent DLL calls.
2. A WavemeterSample class which represents a single period of sampling data from the wavemeter.
    - The attributes will contain:
        - start_time: the time at which the sampling period started
        - end_time: the time at which the sampling period ended
        - data: the actual sampled data (could be a list of values, etc.)
        - metadata: any additional information about the sample (e.g., settings used, etc.)
            - Methodology used to gather data (e.g., single sample, timed sampling, delayed sampling, etc.)
            - The actual DLL method used to gather the data
            - Possibly the type of data being sampled (e.g., wavelength, frequency, pressure, temperature, etc.) (although it'll probably always be wavelength/frequency for our uses)

3. An outside function (possibly the main function of the main file of this module) or class (probably class) is responsible for taking commands and marshalling those commands to the SampleWavemeter class...
...which in turn marshalls those commands to the Wavemeter class methods to perform the actual sampling and data gathering.
    - This is a business logic class that holds the Wavemeter object and SampleWavemeter object and contains methods for starting and stopping samples, holding/processing the data, etc?
We'll call this class WavemeterController or WavemeterManager or WavemeterSampleManager something similar.

WavemeterSample Class Attributes:
    - start_time: the time at which the sampling period started
    - end_time: the time at which the sampling period ended
    - data/buffer: the actual sampled data (could be a list of values, etc.)
    - current_buffer_size: the current size of the data buffer (if applicable) (only applicable if the data structure is a numpy array thats being filled gradually)
    - buffer_capacity: the maximum size of the data buffer (if applicable) (only applicable if the data structure is a numpy array thats being filled gradually)

    - continuous_sampling: a boolean indicating whether the sampling is done as often as possible (run in a continuous loop) or at fixed intervals
    - sampling_interval: the interval at which the sampling is done (if applicable) (only applicable if the sampling is done at fixed intervals)

    - aquisition_method/DLL_method: the method used to gather the data (e.g., get_frequency, get_wavelength, etc.)

WavemeterSample Class Methods:
    - start_sampling: starts the sampling process
    - stop_sampling: stops the sampling process (only useful if sampling can be done continuously and interrupeted (may require sampling to happen in a separate thread))
    - ?process_data: processes the sampled data (e.g., averaging, filtering, etc.)
    - ?get_sample_data: retrieves the sampled data
    - ?get_metadata: retrieves the metadata associated with the sample
    - clear_data/reset_data: clears the sampled data buffer


Derived Classes?:
    - ContinousDurationSample: polls the get_frequency method at a fixed interval (or as often as possisble?) for a specified duration and stores the data in the buffer
    - SingleSample: takes a single sample by calling the get_frequency method once and stores the data in the buffer
    - TimedSample: takes samples at a fixed interval for a specified duration and stores the data in the buffer
    - DelayedSample: takes samples at a fixed interval for a specified duration after a specified delay and stores the data in the buffer
    - EventDrivenSample: takes samples when a frequency event is triggered and stores the data in
    - CallbackSample: takes samples when a frequency event is triggered and processes the data using a callback function

    ^Ignore the above, this is how it will actually work:
    - SampleUntilStop: continuously sample until commanded to stop?, storing data in a buffer
        - SampleEveryNSeconds: sample every N seconds, storing data in a buffer, until stopped or for a specified duration
    - SampleForDuration: sample for a specified duration, storing data in a buffer

    ^ALSO ignore the above, this is how it will possibly actually work:
    - A meta class that holds a Wavemeter object and a SampleWavemeter object will be used for sampling. 
    - This class will have branching logic for different sampling strategies? 
        - Like arguments/attributes of this class may include: continous sampling: Bool, every

    Is there a way for the a SampleWavemeter derived class to have multiple variations of sampling strategies?
        - Like can I have a TimedSample class that can also be used for delayed sampling by passing a delay parameter to the constructor?
        - Or can I have a TimedSample class that in one variant uses a the callback method and in the other variant uses the polling method?
        - TODO: CAN I DO THIS BY: having the "Wavemeter DLL function of interest" be passed as a function pointer/ parameter to the SampleWavemeter class constructor???
        - Like can I pass a pointer to a method of the Wavemeter class to the SampleWavemeter class constructor and then call that method from within the SampleWavemeter class?

TODO: TODO: TODO:
Actually have a Class that has both a Wavemeter object and a SampleWavemeter object as attrributes:
    - Then the Sample Class ONLY represents the sampling strategy and possibly the data processing strategy.
    - The Wavemeter Class ONLY represents the actual wavemeter device and its methods.

    - The Class that holds both uses the Sample object to inform how to poll from/use the Wavemeter object to gather data.

This can be called the WavemeterDataManager or WavemeterController or WavemeterSampleManager or something similar.
This class CAN use the Call the Wavemeter class methods directly, but it should use the SampleWavemeter class methods to gather data and process it.?

TODO: TODO: TODO: TODO: TODO: This is how it will actually work:
Classes:
1. Wavemeter: Represents the wavemeter device and its DLL methods.
2. SamplePoint: A dataclass that represents a single sample point with attributes like timestamp, value, and metadata (if needed)
3. AcquisitionStrategy: a class that overloads the __call__ method to implement different sampling strategies:
    - The __call__ method will take a Wavemeter object and return a single SamplePoint object? Or maybe a list of SamplePoint objects or maybe just a float that something else will use to create a SamplePoint object.
    - the aquisition strategy must have this signature: Callable[[Wavemeter], float]
4. BaseScheduler: A class that manages the scheduling of sampling tasks. It can take an AcquisitionStrategy and a Wavemeter object and run the sampling strategy at a specified interval or for a specified duration.
    - An Abstract Base Class that defines the interface for scheduling sampling tasks.
    - Example derived classes:
        - IntervalScheduler: Runs the sampling strategy at a fixed interval.
        - DurationScheduler: Runs the sampling strategy for a specified duration.

5. SampleSession: The session owns the life-cycle.If you need many sessions in parallel, wrap them in a higher-level WavemeterManager; otherwise SampleSession itself can be “the controller”.

Notes/ideas for streaming data:
    Possible approaches:
    1. Unistall the callback function every time a frequency event occurs.
        - This would mean that the callback function is only called once per frequency event and then uninstalled.
        - Then the callback function could just update a value and the some method could be called to retrieve that value
        - Then this method follows the AquisitionStrategy pattern required
    2. See if we can relax the AquisitionStrategy pattern so we can return a list of floats instead of a single float.
        - Then the get_frequency method could return a list containing just a single float value.
        - Then the callback function could just append the frequency value to a list and then when streaming is stopped, the list can be returned.
    3. Add an attribute to the WavemeterWS7 class that holds a list of frequency values and then the callback function can just append the frequency value to that list. (original idea)
    4. Add an attribute to the WavemeterWS7 class that holds a just the latest frequency value and use a yielding/generator function somehow to return the latest frequency value when requested.
        - This may require another thread or something listening for frequency events or updates to the latest frequency value. Which is highly redundant since the callback function is already doing that.
        - Or maybe the callback function updates the latest frequency value and then calls a method that yields the latest frequency value?

    6? Maybe the scheduler class handles Instantiate and uninstalling the callback function?

    
Idea Scheduler Outline:
    The callback function is defined in the Scheduler class?
    start():
        - Instantiates the callback function
        - When the callback function is called, it updates/appends a value in the scheduler class by means of weak reference or a global variable
        - So no AcquisitionStrategy is Used,
        TODO: So make the AcquisitionStrategy an optional attribute of the Scheduler and Session classes?

    stop():
        - Uninstantiates the callback function

    TODO: reference ChatGPT conversation for more ideas on how to implement this.
"""

# ALL Schedulers should be able be able to be started and stopped (stopping itself is optional) externally
# AND be able to be used multiple times.
# TODO: Scheduler might not be a great name because it doesn't actually decide when to be run.add()
# A better name might be AcquisitionManager or AcquisitionController or something similar.
# AND the overarching facade/controller class that holds one or multiple AcquisitionManager instances, is in charge of...
# Starting and stopping them, and possibly processing the data from them
# These could be called AcquisitionSchedulers or AcquisitionSupervisors
"""Because the managers manage a single acquisition strategy and the schedulers/supervisors manage multiple acquisition managers.

Supervisors may be unnecessary if they would have no similar properties to eachother and would just be created on a case by case basis.

Functions they could have:
- start_at_time(time: datetime) -> None: Start the acquisition at a specific time

OR they could instead be in charge of mediating conversation via TCP between the two computers
"""

# TODO: split base class into too children, one for event-driven callbacks and one for aquisition strategies
# The ABC could have the "AquisitionStrategy" as just a callable and the event-driven ones could specifiy that it must be of a CB format and returns a SamplePoint or float value...
# While the other ones could specify that it must be a callable that takes a WavemeterWS7 object and returns a SamplePoint or float value.

# Concrete Schedulers
# TODO: I'm pretty sure that EVERY scheduler that will wait to be stopped by the Session Object will need to use threading so that the main thread can continue to run and not block on the scheduler.
# TL;DR: If the scheduler is going to wait for a stop signal, it will need to run in a separate thread
# If the sheduler is going to stop on its own after a certain condition is met, then it can propably just run in the main thread. Unless it needs the OPTION to be able to be stopped externally.



""" TODO: This facade class may be unecessary?
IT may be nice for combining all of the scheduler functionality into one class and just having kwargs for the different schedulers, but it may be better to just have a separate class for each scheduler type.
TODO: Session Class should hold all helpful methods for starting and stopping the scheduler, as well as holding the data and processing it.
- It could hold data about multiple runs and aggregate the data from all runs.
- It could hold a list of Schedulers to execute in sequence OR (better idea:) Just hold a single Scheduler, take the data out from it, call clear on it, and start it again when applicable?
- It could seperate each runs data and/or hold metadata on each run or the entire session.
